# ProteomicsTemplate.xlsx
- I would rather move the sheet "Instructions" to the (curated) wiki and only share a persistent link in the template

# ProteomicsTemplate_SamplePreparation.json
- I would split the Sample Prep ("01_SPL") and extraction ("02_EXT") parts into two 


# General
- tag types / functions
	1. User findability: e.g. assay type (proteomics, mass spec) or source type (plants, algae)
	2. Compatibility with repository and metadata standard: e.g. PRIDE, MIAPE
	3. SWATE / ISA QC: You can only combine 01_SPL-02_EXT-03_ASY-04_COM, not e.g. 01_SPL-01_SPL-03_ASY
	
- Maybe in the .json move the latter to a new key `type`

- _Clickable_ interface for the user:
	
Scenario 1: 
	- User: "I want to describe a Plant RNASeq dataset."
	- Interface choice: `Source type` "Plant", `Assay type` "RNASeq"
	- Solution: 01_SPL-02_EXT-03_ASY-04_COM snake for GEO with plant sample prep

Scenario 2: 
	- User: "I want to upload my data to GEO"
	- Interface choice: `Repository` "GEO"
		- Interface dialog: What source? (plant, algae, human, generic)
		- Interface dialog: What assay type? (RNASeq, Single-cell, microarray)
	- Solution: 01_SPL-02_EXT-03_ASY-04_COM snake for GEO with according prep, etc.
